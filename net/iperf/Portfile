description         A tool to measure maximum TCP and UDP bandwidth
long_description    Iperf is a tool for measuring maximum TCP and UDP \
                    bandwidth, reminiscent of ttcp and nettest. It has \
                    been written to overcome the shortcomings of those \
                    aging tools. Iperf can also test UDP bandwidth, \
                    loss, and jitter. Primary development has moved \
                    to Iperf 3 and this is to maintain compatibility \
                    with legacy code and scripts.
